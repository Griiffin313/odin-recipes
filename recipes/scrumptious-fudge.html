                        <ul>
                            <li>1 Can (397g) Sweetened condensed milk</li>
                            <li>150ml Milk</li>
                            <li>450g Demerara Sugar</li>
                            <li>115g Butter</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place all ingredients in a large non-stick saucepan.</li>
                        <li>Melt it over low heat, stirring non-stop until the sugar has dissolved</li>
                        <li>Raise the temperature to a steady boil for 10-15 mins and keep on stirring. Scrape the base of the pan to ensure it doesn't burn</li>
                        <li>Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes</li>
                        <li>Beat the mixture for 5-10 minutes until it loses its glossiness and thickens. Stir for longer if you want crumbly fudge</li>
                        <li>Press into a flat pan on baking parchment to cool. Cut into cubes when cool.</li>
                    </ol>
